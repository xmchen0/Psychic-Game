# Psychic-Game

This is simple guessing game that stores a random secret letter value and prompts users to press a key to guess the correct letter.

## Basic features:
1. Wins: # of times the user has guessed the letter correctly.
2. Losses: # of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses.
3. Guesses Left: # of guesses left. This will update. Players are offered **9 guesses per session**.
4. Your Guesses So Far: the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.
5. When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).
6. When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
